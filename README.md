Automatic Car License Plate Recognition System

The project seamlessly integrates YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model, with EasyOCR to efficiently extract and interpret alphanumeric characters from vehicle license plates in traffic environments. By leveraging YOLOv8's capabilities, the system accurately detects and localizes license plates within images or video streams, while EasyOCR handles the optical character recognition (OCR) tasks. Developed in Python, the project offers a user-friendly interface for real-time or batch processing of vehicle number plates, providing a robust solution for various traffic management applications.
